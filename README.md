# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure used in computer science to organize and store data in a way that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. It consists of nodes connected by edges, where each node can have at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root, and nodes with no children are called leaves.

These are the Objectives of this Project:
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
